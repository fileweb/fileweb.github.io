1. List all the student details studying in fourth semester ‘C’ section.

SELECT S.*, SS.SEM, SS.SEC
FROM STUDENT S, SEMSEC SS, CLASS C
WHERE S.USN = C.USN AND
SS.SSID = C.SSID AND
SS.SEM = 4 AND
SS.SEc=’C’;



2. Compute the total number of male and female students in each semester and in each section.

SELECT SS.SEM, SS.SEC, S.GENDER, COUNT (S.GENDER) AS COUNT
FROM STUDENT S, SEMSEC SS, CLASS C
WHERE S.USN = C.USN AND
SS.SSID = C.SSID
GROUP BY SS.SEM, SS.SEC, S.GENDER
ORDER BY SEM;



3. Create a view of Test1 marks of student USN ‘1BI15CS101’ in all subjects.
CREATE VIEW STU_TEST1_MARKS_VIEW1 AS
SELECT TEST1, SUBCODE
FROM IAMARKS
WHERE USN = '1BI13CS091';




5. Categorize students based on the following criterion:
If FinalIA = 17 to 20 then CAT = ‘Outstanding’
If FinalIA = 12 to 16 then CAT = ‘Average’
If FinalIA< 12 then CAT = ‘Weak’
Give these details only for 8 th semester A, B, and C section students.

SELECT S.USN,S.SNAME,S.ADDRESS,S.PHONE,S.GENDER,
CASE
WHEN IA.FINALIA BETWEEN 17 AND 20 THEN 'OUTSTANDING'
WHEN IA.FINALIA BETWEEN 12 AND 16 THEN 'AVERAGE'
ELSE 'WEAK'
END AS CAT
FROM STUDENT S, SEMSEC SS, IAMARKS IA, SUBJECT SUB
WHERE S.USN = IA.USN AND
SS.SSID = IA.SSID AND
SUB.SUBCODE = IA.SUBCODE AND
SUB.SEM = 8;
